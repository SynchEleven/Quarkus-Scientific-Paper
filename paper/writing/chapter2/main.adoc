=== The Documentation
Just a word about the link:https://quarkus.io/guides/[Quarkus Documentation], it is absoluetly phenomenal. It not only covers a wide range of topics, from getting started with Quarkus to advanced usage and best practices, but also includes detailed explanations of the various features and capabilities of Quarkus, as well as examples and code samples that illustrate how to use these features in practice. So if you want to learn more about any topic discussed in this paper, I would greatly advice you to have a look in the official documentation. 

=== Coming up
This guide will cover the process of setting up Quarkus and creating a reactive programming style project, which is a key feature of Quarkus and well-suited for cloud-native applications. Note that the Quarkus-specific changes introduced in this guide are also applicable to imperative style projects.

****
It is heavily inspired by link:https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-reactive[this] official Quarkus guide -  additional links to further resources will be provided along the way.

=== Prerequisites
- An IDE (Examples will use IntelliJ)
- JDK 19 installed with JAVA_HOME configured
- Maven 3.8.6
- Docker Desktop installed and running 

=== Setup

==== Quarkus CLI
The link:https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling[Quarkus CLI] is an optional tool that allows one to create, run and build Quarkus application. Every setup step in this demonstration could be done with the CLI tool.

===== Quarkus Dev Mode
The Quarkus dev-mode allows the developer to test Quarkus applications in a fast and efficient manner. When dev mode is enabled, Quarkus automatically reloads the application code and resources whenever they are modified, allowing developers to see the results of their changes in real-time. This is particularly useful when developing applications with long start-up times.

There are different ways to start quarkus dev mode:

1. Through the development environment: Most widely popular IDEs have integrations for quarkus which start  automatically into dev mode

2. Through Quarkus CLI: with the ``quarkus dev`` command scoped in the project root directory

3. Through Maven: with the ``./mvnw quarkus:dev`` command

==== Information up front
In this demonstration we are going to create a very simple reactive Quarkus application that will implement a REST endpoint. The application will also be build and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. 

This project assumes that you have already made a project with Endpoints in Java, as none of the "usual" annotations and processes are explained further.

==== Project setup
Quarkus projects can be created using an IDE, the Quarkus Initializer website, or the Quarkus CLI. IntelliJ, used for this demonstration, offers an in-built Quarkus initializer and easy dependency selection, just like the Initializer website that generates a bootstrapped project similar to the Spring Initializer for Spring projects. The Quarkus CLI, which is less recommended, requires specifying dependencies by hand and is therefore tedious and prone to errors.

===== Configuration
In IntelliJ, click on create new Project and select the Quarkus preset:

You have some configuration options here that are the same as with every other Java project. The demonstration projet is called "quarkus-introduction" with group "org.acme" and uses JDK 19 with Maven.

Additionally you can select if you want sample code or not. For starters I would recommend enabling this, since it creates some folders with the right structure, as well as some controllers for an easier learning experience.

===== Extensions
After clicking "Next" you are presented with a list of possible extensions, which you can use in your new Quarkus project. These are basically just maven dependencies so don't worry if you miss one here, you can add them in later by hand (or by using Maven / Quarkus CLI) as well.

For this demonstration we are going to be using:

- RESTEasy Reactive Jackson
- Hibernate Reactive with Panache
- Reactive PostgreSQL client

===== Overview
When creating a project, Quarkus automatically creates a README.md that contains informations and simple guides about the operation of Quarkus and the extension you added. We will cover some of those steps in this demonstration as well.

===== Project Structure
The created project structure should be familiar to most Java developers. A main and test folder were created with just some sample code which is executable. But Quarkus did not only create the standard folders but also automatically created a docker folder containing the necessary Dockerfiles to run the application in a container.

=== Starting it
Our first goal is to start this template application into dev mode. You can chose one of the ways described <<Quarkus Dev Mode>>. It should start without a problem and it was successful when you see the following lines in the output:

image::../images/chapter2/start_project.JPG[start_project]

Now you should be able to see the Quarkus interface on http://localhost:8080/

==== Interface
Quarkus generates an interface for the developer for easier debugging and navigation. Especially helpul are the available Paths on the bottom left hand side and the Dev UI -> reached by clicking the "Visit the Dev UI" button.

The "Dev UI" is a very handy feature when using Quarkus. One can manage bascially everything needed for configuring and debugging their application on it. Going into detail about every feature would exceed the scope of this paper but one can run tests, reset databases, look at endpoints and beans currently in the dependency injection and much more. It therefore, together with the automatic code reload, enables the developer to keep the application running and see the changes instantly without having to restart it constantly.

==== The First Endpoint
Now, with the application up and running, we can take also take a look at the first autogenerated endpoint at http://localhost:8080/hello. You should get the text "Hello from RESTEasy Reactive" back. To check if the auto code reload works, try to change the return text in your src/main/java/org/acme/ExampleResource.java to something different like "Hola from RESTEasy Reactive". You should instantly get that new text after refreshing the localhost page. If this works you can move on to the next part. If this does not work, I would recommend restarting the dev mode or checking if your setup in the previous steps was done correctly.
